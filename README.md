# CascadiaJS 2024 GenAI Workshop

This project is one we built as part of the CascadiaJS GenAI workshop given in 2024 where we pull some data from Twitter, store it in Astra, and perform RAG for personalized GPT responses.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Change directory (`cd`) into the cloned folder
3. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and fill in the environment variables with appropriate accounts

## Usage

To import data into your Astra database, run `import.ts`. Afterwards, to perform RAG, run `ask.ts`.
